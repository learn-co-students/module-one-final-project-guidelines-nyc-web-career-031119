#  def get_question
    # category and difficulty are optional - get_question can take 0-2 args if defined
    # I think we should keep amount set to = 1 so it pulls random each time? - not sure about get_question(amount,category)
    # after question is pulled we can find_or_create_by in the question table
    # after quetion is pulled we can find_or_create_by in player table to determine whether or not they previously answered, if so, pull new quesiton with same args
    # call category_number method to add '&category=X' to API URL?
    # define and call question_difficulty method and dd to API URL?
